criticism and controversies
failure to report ukraine famine
the new york times was criticized for the work of reporter walter duranty who served as its moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936 duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the soviet union and won a pulitzer prize for his work at that time however he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine most particularly the ukrainian famine in the 1930s 205 206 207 208
in 2003 after the pulitzer board began a renewed inquiry the times hired mark von hagen professor of russian history at columbia university to review duranty s work von hagen found duranty s reports to be unbalanced and uncritical and that they far too often gave voice to stalinist propaganda in comments to the press he stated for the sake of the new york times honor they should take the prize away 209
world war ii
on november 14 2001 in the new york times 150th anniversary issue in an article entitled turning away from the holocaust former executive editor max frankel wrote
and then there was failure none greater than the staggering staining failure of the new york times to depict hitler s methodical extermination of the jews of europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in world war ii a nazi war within the war crying out for illumination 210
according to frankel harsh judges of the new york times have blamed self hating jews and anti zionists among the paper s owners and staff frankel responded to this criticism by describing the fragile sensibilities of the jewish owners of the new york times
then too papers owned by jewish families like the times were plainly afraid to have a society that was still widely anti semitic misread their passionate opposition to hitler as a merely parochial cause even some leading jewish groups hedged their appeals for rescue lest they be accused of wanting to divert wartime energies at the times the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of jews was also undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher arthur hays sulzberger he believed strongly and publicly that judaism was a religion not a race or nationality that jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped he thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own he went to great lengths to avoid having the times branded a jewish newspaper he resented other publications for emphasizing the jewishness of people in the news 210
in the same article frankel quotes laurel leff associate professor of journalism at northeastern university who concluded that the newspaper had downplayed nazi germany s targeting of jews for genocide her 2005 book buried by the times documents the paper s tendency before during and after world war ii to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of jews while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the nazis crimes on jews in particular leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper s jewish publisher arthur hays sulzberger concerning jewishness antisemitism and zionism 211
jerold auerbach a guggenheim fellow and fulbright lecturer wrote in print to fit the new york times zionism and israel 1896 2016 212 that it was of utmost importance to adolph ochs the first jewish owner of the paper that in spite of the persecution of jews in germany the times through its reporting should never be classified as a jewish newspaper 213
after ochs death in 1935 his son in law arthur hays sulzberger became the publisher of the new york times and maintained the understanding that no reporting should reflect on the times as a jewish newspaper sulzburger shared ochs concerns about the way jews were perceived in american society his apprehensions about judgement were manifested positively by his strong fidelity to the united states at the same time within the pages of the new york times sulzburger refused to bring attention to jews including the refusal to identify jews as major victims of the nazi genocide to be sure many reports of nazi authored slaughter identified jewish victims as persons the times even opposed the rescue of jewish refugees and backed american constraint 214
during the war the new york times journalist william l laurence was on the payroll of the war department 215 216
accusations of liberal bias
in mid 2004 the newspaper s then public editor daniel okrent wrote an opinion piece in which he said that the new york times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage 125 he stated that this bias reflected the paper s cosmopolitanism which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of new york city writing that the coverage of the times s arts leisure culture and the sunday times magazine trend to the left 125
if you re examining the paper s coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor northeastern nor culturally seen it all if you are among the groups the times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide devout catholics gun owners orthodox jews texans if your value system wouldn t wear well on a composite new york times journalist then a walk through this paper can make you feel you re traveling in a strange and forbidding world
times public editor arthur brisbane wrote in 2012 217
when the times covers a national presidential campaign i have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance and usually succeed in doing so across the paper s many departments though so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism for lack of a better term that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of the times
the new york times public editor ombudsman elizabeth spayd wrote in 2016 that conservatives and even many moderates see in the times a blue state worldview and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim but did opine that the times is part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country that in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources 218 times executive editor dean baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias however 218
we have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in the new york times i want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world not just a segment of it it s a really difficult goal do we pull it off all the time no

critic matt taibbi accused the new york times of favoring hillary clinton over bernie sanders in the paper s news coverage of the 2016 democratic presidential primaries 224 responding to the complaints of many readers the new york times public editor margaret sullivan wrote that the times has not ignored mr sanders s campaign but it hasn t always taken it very seriously the tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive even mocking at times some of that is focused on the candidate s age appearance and style rather than what he has to say 225 times senior editor carolyn ryan defended both the volume of the new york times coverage noting that sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as jeb bush and marco rubio and its tone 226

for its coverage of the israeli palestinian conflict some such as ed koch have claimed that the paper is pro palestinian while others such as as ad abukhalil have insisted that it is pro israel 255 256 the israel lobby and u s foreign policy by political science professors john mearsheimer and stephen walt alleges that the new york times sometimes criticizes israeli policies but is not even handed and is generally pro israel 257 on the other hand the simon wiesenthal center has criticized the new york times for printing cartoons regarding the israeli palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti semitic 258
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity a piece in which thomas friedman commented that praise awarded to netanyahu during a speech at congress was paid for by the israel lobby elicited an apology and clarification from its writer 259
the new york times public editor clark hoyt concluded in his january 10 2009 column 260
though the most vociferous supporters of israel and the palestinians do not agree i think the new york times largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war has tried its best to do a fair balanced and complete job and has largely succeeded
