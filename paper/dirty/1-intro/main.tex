\chapter{Introduction}
The continuing decline of print news readership
has been documented \cite{ma2014, nytimes2019}, alongside the
growth of online social networks (OSN), and their expanding role
in news dissemination \cite{goel2012}.  Within the space of
online news, there are highly automated news recommendation
services, or {\it news aggregators}.  Two popular news aggregators
are {\it Google News} and {\it Yahoo News}.  But there are many more niche news
aggregators.  In Sweden, a service named {\it Omni} exists,
focussing on multi-source news from a Swedish perspective.  In
information technology circles, {\it Hacker News} is popular, a news
aggregator by definition, with some social features.

There are open-source tools allowing people to create their own
aggregators, including {\tt tt-rss} \cite{ttrss} and Thunderbird's newsfeeds feature.
These open-source tools currently lack intelligent functionality
however, and sources must be added manually.  Some online news
sources aren't supported, if the website doesn't provide an RSS
or Atom feed link.
