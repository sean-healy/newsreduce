3 Methodology

    System overview

    Cost considerations

    Stack
        C for hard processing.
        TypeScript for basic application logic and
        integration.
        Shell.
        SQL.

    RDBMS speed and concurrency hacks.

        Configuration tuning.
        No autoincrement - 12 byte IDs based on
        predictable entity hashing.
        No foreign keys, triggers, etc.
        No blind inserts.  Either replace or ignore.
        Bulk insert via CSV.
        Speed over ACID.

                (created, published, crawled).

            Position in document

        Choice of machine learning techniques.
